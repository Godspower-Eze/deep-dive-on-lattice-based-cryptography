# Hard Problems in Lattice-Based Cryptography - Introduction to Lattice-based Cryptography

## Shortest Vector Problems(SVP)

In the first post, we talked about the first successive minimum $\lambda_1$ and good and bad bases. This problem is based on the hardness of finding $\lambda_1$ given a bad basis. 

Given an arbitrary basis $B$ of some lattice $L = L(B)$, find a shortest nonzero lattice vector, i.e a $\mathbf{v} \in L$ for which $||v|| = \lambda_1(L)$.

### Approximate Short Vector Problem($SVP_{\gamma}$)

Given a basis $\mathbf{B}$ of an n-dimensional lattice $L = L(\mathbf{B})$, find a nonzero vector $\mathbf{v} \in L$ for which $||v|| \leq \gamma(n).\lambda_{1}(L)$.
