# Hard Problems in Lattice-Based Cryptography - Introduction to Lattice-based Cryptography

### Shortest Vector Problems(SVP)

In the first post, we talked about successive minimum and how to find it. This problem is based on it.

Given an arbitrary basis $B$ of some lattice $L = L(B)$, find a shortest nonzero lattice vector, i.e a $\mathbf{v} \in L$ for which $||v|| = \lambda_1(L)$.
